///
///  * **cold** — the tap launched the app. The URL is waiting as the initial link, and nothing
///    else will ever deliver it.
///  * **warm** — the app was already running and the OS handed it a URL on the stream.
///
/// The initial link is replayed first, then the stream is attached; `getInitialLink` keeps
/// returning the same launch URL for the process's lifetime, so it is read exactly once here
/// rather than on every rebuild — spending a token twice would make the second attempt look
/// like a spent link.
